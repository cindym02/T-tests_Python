 Assignment 3: T-tests

1) Is there a difference between sex (M:F) and the number of days in hospital? 
Yes, T-test statistic value = 9.542637042242887, P-value = 1.4217299655114968e-21
Statistically significant since P-value <= 0.05, reject null hypothesis

2) Is there a difference between RACE (Caucasian and African American) and the number of days in hospital?
Yes, T-test statistic value = -5.0610017032095325, P-value=4.178330085585203e-07
Statistically significant since P-value <= 0.05, reject null hypothesis

3) Is there a difference between RACE (Asian and African American) and the number of lab procedures performed?
Yes, T-test statistic value = -3.9788715315360292, P-value = 6.948907528800307e-05
Statistically significant since P-value <= 0.05, reject null hypothesis

4) Is there a difference between RACE (([20-30 years] and [60-70 years])) and the number of days in hospital?
Yes, T-test statistic value = -10.795432348028305, P-value = 4.172084976100482e-27
